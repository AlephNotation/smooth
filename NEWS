smooth v1.4.2 (Release date: 2016-09-15)
==============

Changes:

* We now use vignettes, explaining how to work with functions and what they return. This is just a start of the work. Vignettes will be updated. There is also a work on documentation for models underlying smooth package. This is currently reviewed and will be available as a working paper soon.
* New function - sma() - Simple Moving Average. It fits one as a state-space model. So, apparantely there is a model underlying simple moving average method...
* Named transitionX and persistenceX are now returned, when using exogenous variables are used with updateX=TRUE. This should simplify the analysis of these matrices.

Bugfixes:

* A fix for plot(es(...)) in case of inclusion of exogenous variables leading to states containing more than 10 columns.
* Warnings are now always printed out for unstable SSARIMA.


smooth v1.4.1 (Release date: 2016-09-09)
==============

Changes:

* We now suggest testthat package and do more extensive tests in order to make sure that everything works as it should.
* Introduced parameters A and B in ces() function.
* Got rid of parameter C in ces() function.

Bugfixes:

* ssarima() could not construct ARIMA(0,1,0) without constant. Fixed that.


smooth v1.4.0 (Release date: 2016-09-08)
==============

Changes:

* Started this NEWS file.
* Fixed a bug with ssarima() not accepting previously estimated models in cases with constant=TRUE.
* Removed NUS and sim.ces. They will return when they are in a better condition.
